# CSH Gallery

## Overview
A gallery for RIT's [Computer Science House](https://csh.rit.edu), made to replace an instance of [Gallery 2](http://galleryproject.org/). CSH Members can read more about it on our [internal wiki page](https://wiki.csh.rit.edu/wiki/Gallery). CSH Gallery is built using Flask, and hosted on our OpenShift Origin cluster. It allows for uploading of many different common filetypes, and is easily extensible for any new ones that members may want to upload in the future.

## Screenshots
CSH Gallery is an internal site, and thus not public-facing, however below are some screenshots showing how the site looks and works.
